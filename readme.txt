== Description ==

The Share Cluster plug-in is a product we are calling, "Share Cluster." Create your content and then have that content shared with other websites 
inside of the your cluster of owned sites. All of the sites in your cluster will talk to each other site, sharing their content. The plug-in will 
create a custom content-type specific to the Share-Cluster plug-in. These pieces of content can show up in a widget area. Links are clicked and 
people are sent through to a destination page. The links are shared to a network of other AdCluster plugins active on other sites. Each site must 
name and be named to allow the transfer of ads and similar content.
